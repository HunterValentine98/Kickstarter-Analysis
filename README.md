# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, we were given data by Louise. Louise is working on his own play, titled Fever, and would like us to analyze the data he provided to us about other kickstarter projects to see how they performed in certain categories.

### Purpose
The purpose of analyzing this data was for many reasons. Louise wants his play Fever to be a success. The data provided included, successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter projects. By analyzing the data in depth, we could provide Louise information about what made a campaign successful versus what caused a campaign to fail or be canceled.
